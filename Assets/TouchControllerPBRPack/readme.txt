Thank you for purchasing the Oculus Touch Controller PBR Pack!

To use the demo scene, please import OVR into your project.

This pack contains a new lower polygon Oculus Touch Controller mesh and eight Oculus Touch Controller Skins (these skins do not work with the Oculus Utilities or Avatar controller meshes).
Every skin includes an Albedo map, Normal map, and a Metallic/Smoothness map.

Controller models are 5.5k Tris per, compared to the 14.5k Tris of the Oculus controller models.

Bring a new feeling of customization to your project, with skins ranging from elegant leather and glossy wood, to post-apocalyptic rusted metal.

Perfect for any VR project wanting a new look to their controllers, or just a lower poly controller for performance.
